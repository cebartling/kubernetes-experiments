## Docker packaging
1. Create a new repository for your images in Docker Hub. In this case, the repository is `k8s-experiments-01-portal`.
2. Build the image: `npm run build-docker` 
3. Tag the local image: `docker tag k8s-experiments-01-portal:latest cebartling/k8s-experiments-01-portal:latest`
4. Push the image to Docker Hub: `docker push cebartling/k8s-experiments-01-portal:latest`



## Remix

- This is a Remix application using Express.

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
